# SuperResMRI: 
> SINAPP (Modular BIDS App) for Motion-robust Super-Resolution MRI

OG 2019 - Project 03:  Package a portable and reproducible software for motion-robust MRI super-resolution  by SÃ©bastien Tourbier

![](resources/images/superres-mri.jpg)

The essence of this project is to develop the next generation of the open-source [Medical Image Analysis Laboratory Super-Resolution ToolKit (MIALSRTK)](https://github.com/sebastientourbier/mialsuperresolutiontoolkit), a set of C++ image processing tools necessary to perform motion-robust super-resolution fetal MRI reconstruction. This new version will integrate all new advances in the neuroimaging field over the past three years with the advent of:

- the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard to organize and describe neuroimaging data,
- and the BIDS App framework, which promotes reproducibility and portability. all state-of-the-art solutions for enhanced portability, reusability, reproducibility and replicability in neuroimaging.
